This is a project based on the analysis to check if any 2 plants can be mutated using their DNA sequence to create a new plant which can benefit us in some way or the other. This program uses the dataset in the .csv file and uses the DNA sequence of 20 different plants. The frontend is made by using flask, which can be installed for the project using the terminal easily.

The project outlines the advantages and benefits of building the new plant and analyzes the outcomes using different machine learning models.

This is a Python script with some additional files that will help it run with both the frontend and backend.
